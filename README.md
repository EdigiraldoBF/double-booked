# Double booked challenge

This program inspects a given list of date ranges in your schedule and gives you the ones that are overlapping.

To run this challenge:

    - Include your time lapses in the file "date-ranges.txt" with the format "Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006" (RFC 2822) and separated by tabs

    Example:
        Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006	Mon Jan 02 17:31:55 -0700 2006

    - Finally, execute:

        go run main.go
